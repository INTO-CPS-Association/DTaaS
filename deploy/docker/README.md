# DTaaS on Docker

This directory contains docker compose files for running the DTaaS
on both localhost and server.

There are two usage scenarios each with a dedicated set of instructions:

1. Single user [localhost](./LOCALHOST.md)
2. Multi-user [web application](./SERVER.md)

Please choose an appropriate installation scenario.
