# DTaaS on Linux Operating System

These are installation instructions for running DTaaS application
on a Ubuntu Server 22.04 Operating System.
The setup requires a machine which can spare 16GB
RAM, 8 vCPUs and 50GB Hard Disk space.

A dummy **foo.com** URL has been used for illustration.
Please change this to your unique website URL.
It is assumed that you are going to serve the application in only HTTPS mode.

A successful installation will create a setup
similar to the one shown in the figure.

![Single host install](../docs/admin/single-host.png)

Please follow these steps to make this work in your local environment.
Download the codebase as zip file into your computer and unzip the same
into a directory named **DTaaS**.
Alternatively, clone this git repository into your computer.
The rest of the instructions assume
that your working directory is **DTaaS**.

## Configuration

You need to configure the gateway, library microservice and react client website.

The first step is to decide on the number of users and their usenames.
The traefik gateway configuration has a template for two users.
You can modify the usernames in the template to the usernames chosen by you.

### Traefik gateway server

You can run the Traefik gateway server in both
HTTP and HTTPS mode to experience the DTaaS application.
The installation guide assumes that you can run the application in HTTPS mode.

The Traefik gateway configuration is at
_[fileConfig](config/gateway/fileConfig.yml)_.
Change `foo.com` to your local hostname and user1/user2 to the usernames
chosen by you.

**NOTE**: Do not use `http://` or `https://`
in [fileConfig](config/gateway/fileConfig.yml).

#### Authentication

This step requires `htpasswd` commandline utility. If
it is not available on your system, please install the same by using

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y apache2-utils
```

You can now proceed with update of the gateway authentication setup.
The dummy username is `foo` and the password is `bar`.
Please change this before starting the gateway.

```bash
rm deploy/config/gateway/auth
touch deploy/config/gateway/auth
htpasswd deploy/config/gateway/auth <first_username>
password: <your password>
```

The user credentials added in _[config/gateway/auth](config/gateway/auth)_
should match the usernames in
_[config/gateway/fileConfig](config/gateway/fileConfig.yml)_.

## Lib microservice

The library microservice requires configuration.
A template of this configuration file is given in _[config/lib](config/lib)_ file.
Please modify this file as per your needs.

The first step in this configuration is to prepare the a filesystem for users.
An example file system in `files/` directory.
You can rename the top-level user1/user2 to the usernames chosen by you.

Add an environment file named `.env` in lib for the library microservice.
An example `.env` file is given below.
The simplest possibility is to use `local` mode with the following example.
The filepath is the absolute filepath to `files/` directory.
You can copy this configuration into _[config/lib](config/lib)_ file to get started.

```env
PORT='4001'
MODE='local'
LOCAL_PATH ='filepath'
LOG_LEVEL='debug'
APOLLO_PATH='/lib'
GRAPHQL_PLAYGROUND='true'
```

## React Client Website

### Gitlab OAuth application

The DTaaS react website requires Gitlab OAuth provider.
If you need more help with this step, please see
the [Authentication page](../docs/admin/client/auth.md).

You need the following information from the OAuth application
registered on Gitlab:

| Gitlab Variable Name | Variable name in Client env.js | Default Value |
|:---|:---|:---|
| OAuth Provider | REACT_APP_AUTH_AUTHORITY | https://gitlab.foo.com/ |
| Application ID | REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID |
| Callback URL | REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URI | https://foo.com/Library |
| Scopes | REACT_APP_GITLAB_SCOPES | openid, profile, read_user, read_repository, api |

You can also see
[Gitlab help page](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html)
for getting the Gitlab OAuth application details.

If you need more help with this step, please see
the [Authentication page](client/auth.md).

### Update Client Config

Change the React website configuration in _[config/client/env.js](config/client/env.js)_.

```js
window.env = {
  REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT: 'prod',
  REACT_APP_URL: 'https://foo.com/',
  REACT_APP_URL_BASENAME: 'dtaas',
  REACT_APP_URL_DTLINK: '/lab',
  REACT_APP_URL_LIBLINK: '',
  REACT_APP_WORKBENCHLINK_TERMINAL: '/terminals/main',
  REACT_APP_WORKBENCHLINK_VNCDESKTOP: '/tools/vnc/?password=vncpassword',
  REACT_APP_WORKBENCHLINK_VSCODE: '/tools/vscode/',
  REACT_APP_WORKBENCHLINK_JUPYTERLAB: '/lab',
  REACT_APP_WORKBENCHLINK_JUPYTERNOTEBOOK: '',

  REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID: '934b98f03f1b6f743832b2840bf7cccaed93c3bfe579093dd0942a433691ccc0',
  REACT_APP_AUTH_AUTHORITY: 'https://gitlab.foo.com/',
  REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URI: 'https://foo.com/Library',
  REACT_APP_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI: 'https://foo.com/',
  REACT_APP_GITLAB_SCOPES: 'openid profile read_user read_repository api',
};
```

## Update the installation script

Open `deploy/install.sh` and update user1/user2 to usernames chosen by you.

## Perform the Installation

Go to the DTaaS directory and execute

```sh
source deploy/install.sh
```

You can run this script multiple times until the installation is successful.

## Access the application

Now you should be able to access the DTaaS application at: _<http:>https://foo.com</http:>_
