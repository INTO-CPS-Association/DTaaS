    In some cases, Digital Twin models require calibration prior to their use; functions written by domain experts along with right data inputs can make model calibration an achievable goal. Another use of functions is to process the sensor and actuator data of both Physical Twins and Digital Twins.`,

Therefore, it is possible to have multiple models for the same Physical Twin. For example, a flexible robot used in a car production plant may have structural model(s) which will be useful in tracking the wear and tear of parts. The same robot can have a behavioural model(s) describing the safety guarantees provided by the robot manufacturer. The same robot can also have a functional model(s) describing the part manufacturing capabilities of the robot.`,

These tools are executed on top of a computing platforms, i.e., an operating system, or virtual machines like Java virtual machine, or inside docker containers. The tools tend to be platform specific, making them less reusable than models.
    A tool can be packaged to run on a local or distributed virtual machine environments thus allowing selection of most suitable execution environment for a Digital Twin.
    Most models require tools to evaluate them in the context of data inputs.
    There exist cases where executable packages are run as binaries in a computing environment. Each of these packages are a pre-packaged combination of models and tools put together to create a ready to use Digital Twins.`,

Typical examples of data sources are sensor measurements from Physical Twins, and test data provided by manufacturers for calibration of models. Typical examples of data sinks are visualization software, external users and data storage services. There exist special outputs such as events, and commands which are akin to control outputs from a Digital Twin. These control outputs usually go to Physical Twins, but they can also go to another Digital Twin.`,
