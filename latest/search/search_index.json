These tools are executed on top of a computing platforms, i.e., an operating system, or virtual machines like Java virtual machine, or inside docker containers. The tools tend to be platform specific, making them less reusable than models.  A tool can be packaged to run on a local or distributed virtual machine environments thus allowing selection of most suitable execution environment for a Digital Twin.  Most models require tools to evaluate them in the context of data inputs.  There exist cases where executable packages are run as binaries in a computing environment.
