# :runner: Developer Instructions

This microservice needs a configuration file.
Please see [README](./README.md) for this information.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Developer Commands

```bash
yarn install    # Install dependencies for the microservice
yarn syntax     # Analyze code for errors and style issues
yarn graph      # Generate dependency graphs in the code
yarn build      # Compile ES6 to ES5 and copy JS files to build/ directory
yarn test       # Run tests
yarn test:e2e   # Run only end-to-end tests
yarn test:nocov # Run the tests but do not report coverage
yarn test:watchAll # Watch changes in test/ and run the tests
yarn start      # Start the application
yarn clean      # Deletes directories "build", "coverage", and "dist"
```

### On Filenames in Tests

The jest and nestjs combination can not detect tests in files
with _config_ in their names. Hence, the config word has been
replaced with _options_ in the names of test files.

## :package: :ship: NPM package

### Github Package Registry

The Github actions workflow of
[lib microservice](../../../.github/workflows/runner.yml) publishes the **runner**
