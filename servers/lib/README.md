# Overview

The **lib microservice** is a simplified file manager providing graphQL API.
It has three features:

* provide a listing of directory contents.
* transfer a file to user.
* Source files can either come from local file system or from a gitlab instance.

## Gitlab setup

For this microserivce to be functional,
a certain directory or gitlab project structure is expected.
The microservice expects that the gitlab consisting of one group, dtaas (by convention),
and within that group, all of the projects be located,
**user1**, **user2**, ... , as well as a **commons** projects.
Each project corresponds to files of one user.
A sample file structure can be seen in [gitlab dtaas group](https://gitlab.com/dtaas).
You can visit the gitlab documentation on
[groups](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/)
for help on the management of gitlab groups.

You can clone the git repositories from
the [gitlab dtaas](https://gitlab.com/dtaas) group
to get a sample file system structure for the lib microservice.

## :arrow_down: Install

The package is available in Github
[packages registry](https://github.com/orgs/INTO-CPS-Association/packages).

Set the registry and install the package with the following commands

```bash
sudo npm config set @into-cps-association:registry https://npm.pkg.github.com
sudo npm install -g @into-cps-association/libms
```

The _npm install_ command asks for username and password. The username is
your Github username and the password is your Github
[personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).
In order for the npm to download the package, your personal access token
needs to have _read:packages_ scope.

## :gear: Configure

The microservices requires config specified in INI format.
The template configuration file is:

```ini
PORT='4001'
MODE='local' or 'gitlab'
LOCAL_PATH ='/Users/<Username>/DTaaS/files'
GITLAB_GROUP ='dtaas'
GITLAB_URL='https://gitlab.com/api/graphql'
TOKEN='123-sample-token'
LOG_LEVEL='debug'
APOLLO_PATH='/lib' or ''
GRAPHQL_PLAYGROUND='false' or 'true'
```

The `LOCAL_PATH` variable is the absolute filepath to the
location of the local directory which will be served to users
by the Library microservice.

The `GITLAB_URL`, `GITLAB_GROUP` and `TOKEN` are only relevant for `gitlab` mode.
The `TOKEN` should be set to your GitLab Group access API token.
For more information on how to create and use your access token,
[gitlab page](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/settings/group_access_tokens.html).

Once you've generated a token, copy it and replace
the value of `TOKEN` with your token for the gitlab group,

Replace the default values the appropriate values for your setup.

**NOTE**:

1. When \__MODE=local_, only _LOCAL_PATH_ is used.
   Other environment variables are unused.
1. When _MODE=gitlab_, _GITLAB_URL, TOKEN_,
   and _GITLAB_GROUP_ are used; _LOCAL_PATH_ is unused.

## :rocket: Use

Display help.

```bash
libms -h
```

The config is saved `.env` file by convention. The __libms__ looks for
`.env` file in the working directory from which it is run.
If you want to run __libms__ without explicitly specifying the configuration
file, run

```bash
libms
```

To run __libms__ with a custom config file,

```bash
libms -c FILE-PATH
libms --config FILE-PATH
```

If the environment file is named something other than `.env`,
for example as `.env.development`, you can run

```sh
libms -c ".env.development"
```

You can press `Ctl+C` to halt the application.

The microservice is available at: http://localhost:PORT/lib

The [API](https://into-cps-association.github.io/DTaaS/development/user/servers/lib/LIB-MS.html) page shows sample queries and responses.
