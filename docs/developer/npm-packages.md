# Publish NPM packages

The DTaaS software is developed as a monorepo with multiple npm packages.

## Default npm registry

The default registry for npm packages is [npmjs](https://registry.npmjs.org).
The freely-accessible public packages are published to the **npmjs** registry.
The publication step is manual.

```bash
npm login --registry="https://registry.npmjs.org"
cat ~/.npmrc  #shows the auth token for the registry
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=xxxxxxxxxx
yarn publish --registry="https://registry.npmjs.org" \
  --no-git-tag-version --access public
```

At least one package is published to this registry for each release of DTaaS.
This published package is used in the release scripts.

## Github  npm registry

The Github actions of the project publish
[packages](https://github.com/orgs/INTO-CPS-Association/packages?repo_name=DTaaS).
The only limitation is that the users need an
[access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
from Github.

## Private Registry

### Setup private npm registry

Since publishing to [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/) is
irrevocable and public, developers are encouraged to setup their own private
npm registry for local development.
A private npm registry will help with local publish and unpublish steps.

We recommend using [verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org) for this task.
The following commands help you create a working private npm registry
for development.

```bash
docker run -d --name verdaccio -p 4873:4873 verdaccio/verdaccio
npm adduser --registry http://localhost:4873 #create a user on the verdaccio registry
npm set registry http://localhost:4873/
yarn config set registry "http://localhost:4873"
yarn login --registry "http://localhost:4873" #login with the credentials for yarn utility
npm login #login with the credentials for npm utility
```

You can open `http://localhost:4873` in your browser, login with
the user credentials to see the packages published.

#### Publish to private npm registry

To publish a package to your local registry, do:

```bash
yarn install
yarn build #the dist/ directory is needed for publishing step
yarn publish --no-git-tag-version #increments version in package.json, publishes to registry
yarn publish #increments version in package.json, publishes to registry and adds a git tag
```

The package version in package.json gets updated as well. You can
open `http://localhost:4873` in your browser, login with the user credentials
to see the packages published. Please see
[verdaccio docs](https://verdaccio.org/docs/installation/#basic-usage)
for more information.

If there is a need to unpublish a package, ex: `@dtaas/runner@0.0.2`, do:

```bash
npm unpublish  --registry http://localhost:4873/ @dtaas/runner@0.0.2
```

To install / uninstall this utility for all users, do:

```bash
sudo npm install  --registry http://localhost:4873 -g @dtaas/runner
sudo npm list -g # should list @dtaas/runner in the packages
sudo npm remove --global @dtaas/runner
```

### :rocket: Use the packages

The packages available in private npm registry can be used like
the regular npm packages installed from [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/).

For example, to use `@dtaas/runner@0.0.2` package, do:

```bash
sudo npm install  --registry http://localhost:4873 -g @dtaas/runner
runner # launch the digital twin runner
```
