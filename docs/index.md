# What is DTaaS?

The Digital Twin as a Service (DTaaS) software platform is useful
to <font color="orange"> **Build, Use and Share** </font> digital twins (DTs).

reusable DT assets available on the platform.

:office_worker: :factory_worker: <font color="orange">**Use**</font>: Run your
DTs on DTaaS.

:handshake: <font color="orange">**Share**</font>: Share ready-to-use DTs
with other users. It is also possible to share the services
offered by one DT with other users.
