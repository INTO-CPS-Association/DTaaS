# What is DTaaS

The Digital Twin as a Service (DTaaS) software is useful
to create and run digital twins.
The digital twins that are running can be used as service by other users.
These users of digital twins need not be members of the DTaaS software platform itself.

There is an overview of the software available in the form of
[slides](https://odin.cps.digit.au.dk/into-cps/dtaas/assets/DTaaS-short-intro.pdf),

and [feature walkthrough](https://odin.cps.digit.au.dk/into-cps/dtaas/assets/videos/dtaas-v0.2.0-demo.mp4).
