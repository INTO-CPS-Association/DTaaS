## Setting Up OAuth

To enable user authentication on DTaaS React client website, you'll use the OAuth authentication protocol, specifically the PKCE authentication flow. Here are the steps to get started:

**1. Choose Your GitLab Server:**

- You need to set up OAuth authentication on a GitLab server. The commercial gitlab.com is not suitable for multi-user authentication (DTaaS requires this), so you'll need an on-premise GitLab instance.
- You can use [GitLab Omnibus Docker for this purpose](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/docker.html).
- Configure the OAuth application as an [instance-wide authentication type](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html#create-an-instance-wide-application).

**2. Determine Your Website's Hostname:**

- Before setting up OAuth on GitLab, decide on the hostname for your website. It's recommended to use a self-hosted GitLab instance, which you'll use in other parts of the DTaaS application.

**3. Define Callback and Logout URLs:**

- For the PKCE authentication flow to function correctly, you need two URLs: a callback URL and a logout URL.
- The callback URL informs the OAuth provider of the page where signed-in users should be redirected. It's different from the landing homepage of the DTaaS application.
- The logout URL is where users will be directed after logging out.

**4. OAuth Application Creation:**

- During the creation of the OAuth application on GitLab, you need to specify the scope. Choose openid, profile, read_user, read_repository, and api scopes.

**5. Application ID:**

- After successfully creating the OAuth application, GitLab generates an application ID. This is a long string of HEX values that you'll need for your configuration files.

**6. Required Information from OAuth Application:**

- You'll need the following information from the OAuth application registered on GitLab:

|GitLab Variable Name|Variable Name in Client env.js|Default Value|
|---|---|---|
|OAuth Provider|REACT_APP_AUTH_AUTHORITY|[https://gitlab.foo.com/](https://gitlab.foo.com/)|
|Application ID|REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID||
|Callback URL|REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URI|[https://foo.com/Library](https://foo.com/Library)|
|Scopes|REACT_APP_GITLAB_SCOPES|openid, profile, read_user, read_repository, api|

## Development Environment

There needs to be a valid callback and logout URLs for development and testing
purposes. You can use the same oauth application id for both development, testing
and deployment scenarios. Only the callback and logout URLs change. It is possible
to register multiple callback URLs in one oauth application. In order to use oauth
for development and testing on developer computer (localhost), you need to add the
following to oauth callback URL.

```txt
DTaaS application URL: http://localhost:4000
Callback URL: http://localhost:4000/Library
Logout URL: http://localhost:4000
```

The port 4000 is the default port for running the client website.

## Multiple DTaaS applications

The DTaaS is a regular web application. It is possible to host multiple DTaaS
applications on the same server. The only requirement is to have a distinct URLs.
You can have three DTaaS applications running at the following URLs.

```txt
https://foo.com/au
https://foo.com/acme
https://foo.com/bar
```

All of these instances can use the same gitlab instance for authentication.

| DTaaS application URL | Gitlab Instance URL | Callback URL | Logout URL | Application ID |
|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
| https://foo.com/au | https://foo.gitlab.com | https://foo.com/au/Library | https://foo.com/au | autogenerated by gitlab |
| https://foo.com/acme | https://foo.gitlab.com | https://foo.com/au/Library | https://foo.com/au | autogenerated by gitlab |
| https://foo.com/bar | https://foo.gitlab.com | https://foo.com/au/Library | https://foo.com/au | autogenerated by gitlab |
||

If you are hosting multiple DTaaS instances on the same server,
do not a DTaaS with a null basename on the same server.
Even though it works well, the setup is confusing to setup
and may lead to maintenance issues.

If you choose to host your DTaaS application with a basename (say bar), then the
URLs in `env.js` change to:

```txt
DTaaS application URL: https://foo.com/bar
Gitlab instance URL: https://foo.gitlab.com
Callback URL: https://foo.com/bar/Library
Logout URL: https://foo.com/bar
```
