# Trial Installation

To try out the software, you can install it on Ubuntu Server 22.04
Operating System. The setup requires a
machine which can spare 16GB RAM, 8 vCPUs and 50GB Hard Disk
space to the vagrant box.
A successful installation will create a setup
similar to the one shown in the figure.

![Single host install](./single-host.png)

A one-step installation script is provided on this page. This script sets up
the DTaaS software with default credentials and users.
You can use it to check a test installation of DTaaS software.

## Pre-requisites

### 1. Domain name

You need a domain name to run the application. The install script
assumes **foo.com** to be your domain name. You will change this
after running the script.

### 2. Gitlab OAuth application

The DTaaS react website requires Gitlab OAuth provider.
If you need more help with this step, please see
the [Authentication page](client/auth.md).

You need the following information from the OAuth application registered on Gitlab:

| Gitlab Variable Name | Variable name in Client env.js | Default Value                                    |
| :------------------- | :----------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| OAuth Provider       | REACT_APP_AUTH_AUTHORITY       | https://gitlab.foo.com/                          |
| Application ID       | REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID            |
| Callback URL         | REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URI         | https://foo.com/Library                          |
| Scopes               | REACT_APP_GITLAB_SCOPES        | openid, profile, read_user, read_repository, api |

You can also see
[Gitlab help page](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html)
for getting the Gitlab OAuth application details.

## Install

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! note
    While installing you might encounter multiple dialogs asking,
    which services should be restarted. Just click **OK** to all of those.

Run the following scripts.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INTO-CPS-Association/DTaaS/feature/distributed-demo/deploy/single-script-install.sh
bash single-script-install.sh
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! warning
    This test installation has default credentials and is thus highly insecure.

## Post install

After the install-script. Please change **foo.com**
and [Gitlab OAuth](#2-gitlab-oauth-application) details
to your local settings in the following files.

```txt
~/DTaaS/client/build/env.js
~/DTaaS/servers/config/gateway/dynamic/fileConfig.yml
```

## Post-install Check

Now when you visit your domain, you should be able to login through your
OAuth Provider and be able to access the DTaas web UI.

If you can following all the screenshots from
[user website](../user/website/index.md).
Everything is correctly setup.
