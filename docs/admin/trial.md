# Trial Installation

The software can be installed either on
Ubuntu Server 22.04 Operating System or
on vagrant virtual machine(s).

A single step install script is helpful in performing a
trial run of the software. This script installs DTaaS software
with default credentials and users on a Ubuntu server OS.
You can use it to check a test installation of DTaaS.

```bash
wget https://github.com/INTO-CPS-Association/DTaaS/feature/distributed-demo/deploy/single-script-install.sh
bash single-script-install.sh
```

!!! warning
    This test installation has default credentials and is thus highly insecure.
