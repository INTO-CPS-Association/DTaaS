# Independent Packages

The DTaaS development team publishes reusable packages which are then
put together to form the complete DTaaS application.

The packages are published on
[github](https://github.com/orgs/INTO-CPS-Association/packages?repo_name=DTaaS),
[npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/org/into-cps-association), and
[docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/intocps) repositories.

The packages on
[github](https://github.com/orgs/INTO-CPS-Association/packages?repo_name=DTaaS)
are published more frequently but are not user tested.
The packages on [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/org/into-cps-association)
and [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/intocps)
are published at least once per release.
The regular users are encouraged to use the packages from npm and docker.

A brief explanation of the packages is given below.
