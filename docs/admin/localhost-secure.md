# Install DTaaS on localhost with Gitlab Integration

This installation is ideal for single users intending to use
DTaaS on their own computers.

The installation instructions provided in this README are
ideal for running the **DTaaS on localhost served over HTTPS connection**.
**The intention is to integrate Gitlab into DTaaS so that both**
**are running on localhost.**

If you do not need gitlab running on localhost, please use
the simpler [localhost setup](localhost.md).

## Design

An illustration of the docker containers used and the authorization
setup is shown here.

## Requirements

The installation requirements to run this docker version of the DTaaS are:

- docker desktop / docker CLI with compose plugin
- [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)

## Clone Codebase

```bash
git clone https://github.com/INTO-CPS-Association/DTaaS.git
cd DTaaS
```

:clipboard: file pathnames

1. The filepaths shown here follow POSIX convention.
   The installation procedures also work with Windows
   paths.
1. The description below refers to filenames. All the file
   paths mentioned below are relatively to the top-level
   **DTaaS** directory.

## Configure and Run

### Create User Workspace

The existing filesystem for installation is setup for `user1`.
A new filesystem directory needs to be created for the selected user.

Please execute the following commands from the top-level directory
of the DTaaS project.

```bash
cp -R files/user1 files/username
```

where _username_ is the selected username to be created (in next steps)
on Gitlab running at <https://localhost/gitlab>.

### Obtain TLS / HTTPS Certificate

Use [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) to generate
TLS certificates using
[this guide](https://kifarunix.com/create-locally-trusted-ssl-certificates-with-mkcert-on-ubuntu-20-04/).
The certificates need to be generated for `localhost`.

The names of the certificates must be `fullchain.pem` and `privkey.pem`.
The `fullchain.pem` corresponds to public certificate and
the `privkey.pem` corresponds to private key.

### Add TLS Certificates to Traefik

Copy the two certificate files into:

- `deploy/docker/certs/localhost/fullchain.pem`
- `deploy/docker/certs/localhost/privkey.pem`

Traefik will run with self-issued certificates if the above two certificates
are either not found or found invalid.

### Configure Docker Compose

The docker compose configuration is in `deploy/docker/.env.local`;
it is a sample file.
It contains environment variables
that are used by the docker compose files.
It can be updated to suit your local installation scenario.
It contains the following environment variables.

Edit all the fields according to your specific case.

  | URL Path | Example Value | Explanation |
  |:------------|:---------------|:---------------|
  | DTAAS_DIR | '/home/Desktop/DTaaS' | Full path to the DTaaS directory. This is an absolute path with no trailing slash. |
  | username1 | 'user1' | Your gitlab username |

:clipboard: Important points to note:

1. The path examples given here are for Linux OS.
   These paths can be Windows OS compatible paths as well.
1. The client configuration file is located at
   `deploy/config/client/env.local.js`.
   Edit the URLs in this file by replacing `http` with `https`.
   Beyond this, it is not necessary to modify this file.

### Start DTaaS to Integrate Gitlab

Start the appliation with

```bash
docker compose -f compose.local.secure.yml --env-file .env.local up -d
```

### Start Gitlab

Use the instructions provided in
[gitlab integration](gitlab/index.md) to bring up
Gitlab on localhost and the Gitlab service will be available at <https://localhost/gitlab>

### Register OAuth2 Application

The frontend website requires OAuth2 application registration on the integrated Gitlab.
The details of Oauth2 app for the frontend website are in
[client docs](client/auth.md).

The default OAuth client application provided in `env.local.js` works.
However, if you intend to run an
[integrated gitlab instance](gitlab/index.md), then
this application needs to be created on gitlab running at <https://localhost/gitlab>.

Remember to use <https://localhost/Library> as the Callback URL (`REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URI`).

Please see
[gitlab oauth provider](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html)
documentation for further help with creating this OAuth application.

### Update Client Website Configuration

Replace the contents of `deploy/config/client/env.local.js` with
the following.

```js
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  window.env = {
    REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT: 'local',
    REACT_APP_URL: 'https://localhost/',
    REACT_APP_URL_BASENAME: '',
    REACT_APP_URL_DTLINK: '/lab',
    REACT_APP_URL_LIBLINK: '',
    REACT_APP_WORKBENCHLINK_VNCDESKTOP: '/tools/vnc/?password=vncpassword',
    REACT_APP_WORKBENCHLINK_VSCODE: '/tools/vscode/',
    REACT_APP_WORKBENCHLINK_JUPYTERLAB: '/lab',
    REACT_APP_WORKBENCHLINK_JUPYTERNOTEBOOK: '',

    REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID: 'xxxxxx',
    REACT_APP_AUTH_AUTHORITY: 'https://localhost/gitlab/',
    REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URI: 'https://localhost/Library',
    REACT_APP_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI: 'https://localhost/',
    REACT_APP_GITLAB_SCOPES: 'openid profile read_user read_repository api',
  };
};
```

And then update OAuth2 client application ID (`REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID`) with that
of the newly registered OAuth2 application.

### Restart DTaaS Client Website

To update the client website configuration, run

```bash
docker compose -f compose.local.secure.yml --env-file .env.local up -d --force-recreate client
```

## Use

The application will be accessible at:
<https://localhost> from web browser.
Sign in using your <https://localhost/gitlab> account.

All the functionality of DTaaS should be available to you
through the single page client now.

## Limitations

The [library microservice](servers/lib/docker.md) is not
included in the localhost installation scenario.

## Docker Help

The commands to start and stop the appliation are:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.local.secure.yml --env-file .env.local up -d
docker compose -f compose.local.secure.yml --env-file .env.local down
```

To restart only a specific container, for example `client`

```bash
docker compose -f compose.local.secure.yml --env-file .env.local up -d --force-recreate client
```
