# Link services to local ports

!!! Requirements

    - User needs to have an account on server2.
    - SSH server must be running on server2

To link a port from the service machine (server2)
to the local port on the user workspace.
You can use ssh local port forwarding technique.

**1. Step:**

Go to the user workspace, on which you want to map
from localhost to the services machine

- e.g. `foo.com/user1`

**2. Step:**

Open a terminal in your user workspace.

**3. Step:**

Run the following command to map a port:

```sh
ssh -fNT -L <local_port>:<destination>:<destination_port> <user>@<services.server.com>
```

Here's an example mapping the RabbitMQ broker service available at 5672 of
_services.foo.com_ to localhost port 5672.

```sh
ssh -fNT -L 5672:localhost:5672 vagrant@services.foo.com
```

Now the programs in user workspace can treat the RabbitMQ broker service as
a local service running within user workspace.
