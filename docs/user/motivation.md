# DTaaS for Users

## User Guide

This guide is for users of the DTaaS platform.
Please make sure that you have access to a live installation of
the DTaaS platform. The easiest is
[localhost](../admin/localhost.md) installation scenario.

Please see user-specific
[Slides](https://odin.cps.digit.au.dk/into-cps/dtaas/assets/20240917-Users.pdf)
and
[Video](https://odin.cps.digit.au.dk/into-cps/dtaas/assets/videos/20240917-Users-Recorded-web.mp4)
to get the conceptual framework behind composable digital twins in the DTaaS platform.

## Motivation

How can DT software platforms enable users collaborate to:

* Build digital twins (DTs)
* Use DTs themselves
* Share DTs with other users
* Provide the existing DTs as Service to other users

In addition, how can the DT software platforms:

* Support DT lifecycle
* Scale up rather than scale down (flexible convention over configuration)

## Existing Approaches

There are quite a few solutions proposed in the recent past to solve
this problem. Some of them are:

* Focus on data from Physical Twins (PTs) to
  perform analysis, diagnosis, planning etc…
* Share DT assets across the upstream, downstream etc….
* Evaluate different models of PT
* DevOps for Cyber Physical Systems (CPS)
* Scale DT / execution of DT / ensemble of related DTs
* Support for PT product lifecycle

## Our Approach

* Support for transition from existing workflows to DT frameworks
* Create DTs from reusable assets
* Enable users to share DT assets
* Offer DTs as a Service
* Integrate the DTs with external software systems
* Separate configurations of independent DT components
