# Incubator Digital Twin

## Overview

This is a case study of an Incubator with the purpose of understanding
the steps and processes involved in developing a digital twin system.
This incubator is an insulated container with the ability to keep a temperature
and heat, but not cool. A picture of the incubator is given below.

![Incubator Picture](figures/incubator_pt.png)

The overall purpose of the system is to reach a certain temperature within
a box and keep the temperature regardless of content.
An overview of the system can be seen below:

![Incubator Schematic](figures/system.svg)

The system consists of:

* 1x styrofoam box in order to have an insulated container
* 1x heat source to heat up the content within the Styrofoam box.
* 1x fan to distribute the heating within the box
* 2x temperature sensor to monitor the temperature within the box
* 1x temperature Sensor to monitor the temperature outside the box
* 1x controller to actuate the heat source and the fan and read sensory
  information from the temperature sensors, and communicate with
  the digital twin.

The original repository for the example can be found: [Original repository](https://github.com/INTO-CPS-Association/example_digital-twin_incubator/).
This trimmed version of the codebase does not have the following:

* docker support
* tests
* datasets

The original repository contains the complete documentation of
the example, including the full system architecture, instructions for
running with a physical twin, and instructions for running
a 3D visualization of the incubator.

## Digital Twin Structure

![System overview of the incubator](figures/dt-structure.svg)

This diagrams shows the main components and the interfaces they use to communicate.
All components communicate via the RabbitMQ message exchange,
and the data is stored in a time series database.
The RabbitMQ and InfluxDB are platform services hosted by the DTaaS.

The Incubator digital twin is a pre-packaged digital twin. It can be
used as is or integrated with other digital twins.

The mock physical twin is executed from
`incubator/mock_plant/real_time_model_solver.py` script.

## Digital Twin Configuration

This example uses a plethora of Python scripts to run the digital twin.
By default it is configured to run with a mock physical twin.
Furthermore, it depends on a RabbitMQ and an InfluxDB instances.

There is one configuration file: `simulation.conf`.
The RabbitMQ and InfluxDB configuration parameters need to be updated.

## Lifecycle Phases

The lifecycles that are covered include:

| Lifecycle Phase    | Completed Tasks |
| --------- | ------- |
| Create    | Potentially updates the system and installs Python dependencies |
| Execute   | Executes the Incubator digital twin and produces output in the terminal and in _incubator/log.log_. |
| Clean     | Removes the log file. |

## Run the example

To run the example, change your present directory.

```bash
cd /workspace/examples/digital_twins/incubator
```

If required, change the execute permission of lifecycle scripts
you need to execute, for example:

```bash
chmod +x lifecycle/create
```

Now, run the following scripts:

### Create

Potentially updates the system and installs Python dependencies.

```bash
lifecycle/create
```

### Execute

Executes the Incubator digital twin with a mock physical twin.
Pushes the results in the terminal, _incubator/log.log_, and in InfluxDB.

```bash
lifecycle/execute
```

### Clean

Removes the output log file.

```bash
lifecycle/clean
```

## Examining the results

After starting all services successfully, the controller service will
start producing output that looks like the following:

````log

````

An InfluxDB dashboard can be setup based on
`incubator/digital_twin/data_access/influxdbserver/dashboards/incubator_data.json`.
If the dashboard on the InfluxDB is setup properly,
the following visualization can be seen:
