# DTaaS Examples

There are some example digital twins created for the DTaaS software.
Use these examples and follow the steps given in the **Examples** section
to experience features of the DTaaS software platform and understand
best practices for managing digital twins within the platform.

You can also see a
[short video](https://odin.cps.digit.au.dk/into-cps/dtaas/assets/videos/cpsens.mp4)
on the use of DTaaS for creating a digital shadow. This video is recorded using
DTaaS v0.2.0.

## Copy Examples

The first step is to copy all the example code into your
user workspace within the DTaaS.
Use the given shell script to copy all the examples
into `/workspace/examples` directory.

```bash
